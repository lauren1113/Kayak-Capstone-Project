  <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="holdPaddle">How to Hold Your Paddle</a></h4>
  <img id="holdPadImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/filip-mroz-zK049OFP4uI-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
  <p class="bg-p" id="holdPdl-p">
        First, make sure the blades of the paddle are aligned and facing the same direction.<br>
        Then, grasp your paddle with both hands about 16 inches (40cm) apart, with your knuckles facing upward. </p>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <img id="pdlOvrHd" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/vitaliy-zamedyanskiy-NGFgFTKQzSM-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">
        You want to make sure your hands are evenly spaced apart. It helps to hold the paddle over your head, aligning the center of the paddle over the top of your head. Your hands are aligned correctly when your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. <br>
        Once you've found this position, lower your paddle in front of you, and make sure your knuckles are in line with the blades of the paddle.</p>
    <p class="bg-p">The longer edge of each blade should be on top, and the concaved sides of the paddle blades should be facing you. You can think of it as if you will be "scooping" the water behind you, pulling your kayak through the water. <br>
        Hold the paddle about 1 foot (30cm) in front of you.
      </p>

<h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="strokes">Basic Paddling Strokes</a></h4>
<p id="bgNote">Note: You can start with either the left or the right side. I am just choosing to make the instructions more clear.</p>
<h6>Forward Stroke</h6>
</div>
<div class="bgBox">
  <p class="bg-p">Immerse the left blade into the water toward the front of the boat.<br>
    <br>
  Rotate your torso as you move the left blade through the water toward the back of the boat.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, use your right hand to push the right side of the paddle forward.<br>
  <br>
  As the left blade reaches your left side, just behind your hip, slice the blade out of the water.<br>
  <br>
 As the right blade reaches the front of the boat, immerse it into the water, and repeat.
</p>
<img id="fwdStrokeImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/pete-nowicki-8G_VvJrYKkE-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
</div>
<p class="bg-p">
  As you paddle with your arms, it is helpful to also peddle your feet, almost as if you are peddling a bicycle. As you immerse the left blade at the front of your boat, push down with your left foot and lean a bit to your left. As you switch to the right blade, push down with your right foot.
</p>

<h6>Reverse Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <p class="bg-p">To stop the kayak, reverse your stroke: Immerse the blade next to your hip and push it forward. Depending on the amount of force, this motion will either stop your kayak or move it backwards.</p>
    <img id="backStrokeImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/kalen-emsley-NrN5Rvl89Lo-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">When you are traveling on a current, you can simply dip your paddle into the water to steer. Dipping into the left side of the boat will point the front of the boat toward the left side.</p>
  </div>
  <break></break>

<h6>Sweep Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <img id="sweepStkImg" src=https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/kal-visuals-Bt_J-VvC9-A-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">To turn your kayak around, you can immerse your paddle toward the front of the boat and "sweep" it toward the back of the boat. This is similar to the Forward Stroke, but a larger movement, sweeping the paddle further from the boat in a wide arc motion. Sweeping on the left side of your boat will turn it right, and sweeping on the right side will turn it toward the left.</p>
