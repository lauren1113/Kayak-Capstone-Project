  <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="holdPaddle">How to Hold Your Paddle</a></h4>
  <img id="holdPadImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/filip-mroz-zK049OFP4uI-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
  <p class="bg-p" id="holdPdl-p">
        First, make sure the blades of the paddle are aligned and facing the same direction.<br>
        Then, grasp your paddle with both hands about 16 inches (40cm) apart, with your knuckles facing upward. </p>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <img id="pdlOvrHd" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/vitaliy-zamedyanskiy-NGFgFTKQzSM-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">
        To make sure your hands are evenly spaced apart, hold the paddle over your head and align the center of the paddle with the top of your head. Lower your paddle in front of you and make sure your knuckles are in line with the blades of the paddle.</p>
    <p class="bg-p">The longer edge of each blade should be on top, and the concaved sides of the  blades should be facing you. Hold the paddle about 1 foot (30cm) in front of you.
      </p>

<h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="strokes">Basic Paddling Strokes</a></h4>

<h6>Forward Stroke</h6>
<div class="bgBox">
  <p class="bg-p">Immerse the left blade into the water toward the front of the boat.<br>
    <br>
  Rotate your torso as you move the left blade through the water toward the back of the boat.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, use your right hand to push the right side of the paddle forward.<br>
  <br>
  As the left blade reaches your left side, just behind your hip, slice the blade out of the water.<br>
  <br>
 As the right blade reaches the front of the boat, immerse it into the water, and repeat.
</p>
<img id="fwdStrokeImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/pete-nowicki-8G_VvJrYKkE-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
</div>
<p class="bg-p">
  As you paddle with your arms, it is helpful to also peddle your feet, almost as if you are peddling a bicycle. As you immerse the left blade at the front of your boat, push down with your left foot and lean a bit to your left. As you switch to the right blade, push down with your right foot.
</p>

<h6>Reverse Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <p class="bg-p">To stop the kayak, reverse your stroke: Immerse the blade next to your hip and push it forward. Depending on the amount of force, this motion will either stop your kayak or move it backwards.</p>
    <img id="backStrokeImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/kalen-emsley-NrN5Rvl89Lo-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">When you are traveling on a current, you can simply dip your paddle into the water to steer. Dipping into the left side of the boat will point the front of the boat toward the left side.</p>
  </div>
  <break></break>

<h6>Sweep Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <img id="sweepStkImg" src=https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/kal-visuals-Bt_J-VvC9-A-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">To turn your kayak around, you can immerse your paddle toward the front of the boat and "sweep" it toward the back of the boat. This is similar to the Forward Stroke, but a larger movement, sweeping the paddle further from the boat in a wide arc motion. Sweeping on the left side of your boat will turn it right, and sweeping on the right side will turn it toward the left.</p>
  </div>

    <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="launch">How to Launch Your Kayak</a></h4>

<p class="bg-p">When possible, place the kayak on a gently sloping beach or boat launch. Unless you have a composite boat, the best place to launch and land a kayak is a nice sandy beach. If you have a composite boat, you will need to float your boat completely in the water before you get in. </p>
<img id="beachLaunch" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/rohith-goura-4Z2yuAcfWyM-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>

<h6>Launching from a Beach</h6>
<div class="bgBox">
  <img id="crlyhrgrl" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/javardh-EfCMlIENz94-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
<ul class="bg-p">
  <li>Carry your boat to the shore, aligning the back of the cockpit with the edge of the water.</li>
  <li>If you have a partner, ask them to hold the boat in place while you enter. Then your partner can go to the stern of the boat and help push you in.</li>
  <li>Approach the side of cockpit, with both feet on the same side of the boat.</li>
  <li>Place the paddle perpendicular to the kayak, with the shaft resting on the boat behind your seat, and one of the blades resting on the beach for stability.</li>
  <li>Hold onto the paddle as you sit on back edge of cockpit.</li>
  <li>With one hand on each side of the paddle, lift your feet into the boat, then lower yourself down onto your seat.</li>
  <li>Hold the paddle vertically in one hand, and make a fist with the other. Push the paddle and your fist into the beach, pushing yourself into the water. It helps to also use the momentum of your hips to scoot into the water.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h6>Tandem Tips</h6>

  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Decide who is the bow paddler (in the front) and who is at the stern. The stern paddle is typically the more comfortable steering partner. This partner will probably have to get their feet wet.</li>
    <li>Carry the bow of your kayak out into the water.</li>
    <li>The bow paddler should get in first, holding onto the paddles.</li>
    <li>The stern paddler will then push the boat parallel into the shore and hop in, feet first, keeping their center of gravity as low as possible.</li>
  </ul>
