  <p class="bg-p" id="holdPdl-p">
        First, make sure the blades of the paddle are aligned and facing the same direction.<br>
        Then, grasp your paddle with both hands about 16 inches (40cm) apart, with your knuckles facing upward. </p>
  <div class="bgBox">

    <p class="bg-p">
        To make sure your hands are evenly spaced apart, hold the paddle over your head and align the center of the paddle with the top of your head. Lower your paddle in front of you and make sure your knuckles are in line with the blades of the paddle.</p>
    <p class="bg-p">The longer edge of each blade should be on top, and the concaved sides of the  blades should be facing you. Hold the paddle about 1 foot (30cm) in front of you.

  <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="strokes">Basic Paddling Strokes</a></h4>

  <h6>Forward Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
  <p class="bg-p">Immerse the left blade into the water toward the front of the boat.<br>
    <br>
  Rotate your torso as you move the left blade through the water toward the back of the boat.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time, use your right hand to push the right side of the paddle forward.<br>
  <br>
  As the left blade reaches your left side, just behind your hip, slice the blade out of the water.<br>
  <br>
  As the right blade reaches the front of the boat, immerse it into the water, and repeat.
  </p>
  <img id="fwdStrokeImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/pete-nowicki-8G_VvJrYKkE-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
  </div>
  <p class="bg-p">
  As you paddle with your arms, it is helpful to also peddle your feet, almost as if you are peddling a bicycle. As you immerse the left blade at the front of your boat, push down with your left foot and lean a bit to your left. As you switch to the right blade, push down with your right foot.
  </p>

  <h6>Reverse Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <p class="bg-p">To stop the kayak, reverse your stroke: Immerse the blade next to your hip and push it forward. Depending on the amount of force, this motion will either stop your kayak or move it backwards.</p>
    <img id="backStrokeImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/kalen-emsley-NrN5Rvl89Lo-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">When you are traveling on a current, you can simply dip your paddle into the water to steer. Dipping into the left side of the boat will point the front of the boat toward the left side.</p>
  </div>
  <break></break>

  <h6>Sweep Stroke</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <img id="sweepStkImg" src=https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/kal-visuals-Bt_J-VvC9-A-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <p class="bg-p">To turn your kayak around, you can immerse your paddle toward the front of the boat and "sweep" it toward the back of the boat. This is similar to the Forward Stroke, but a larger movement, sweeping the paddle further from the boat in a wide arc motion. Sweeping on the left side of your boat will turn it right, and sweeping on the right side will turn it toward the left.</p>

  <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="launch">How to Launch Your Kayak</a></h4>

  <p class="bg-p">When possible, place the kayak on a gently sloping beach or boat launch. Unless you have a composite boat, the best place to launch and land a kayak is a nice sandy beach. If you have a composite boat, you will need to float your boat completely in the water before you get in. </p>
  <img id="beachLaunch" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/rohith-goura-4Z2yuAcfWyM-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>

  <h6>Launching from a Beach</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
  <img id="crlyhrgrl" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/javardh-EfCMlIENz94-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
  <ul class="bg-p">
  <li>Carry your boat to the shore, aligning the back of the cockpit with the edge of the water.</li>
  <li>If you have a partner, ask them to hold the boat in place while you enter. Then your partner can go to the stern of the boat and help push you in.</li>
  <li>Approach the side of cockpit, with both feet on the same side of the boat.</li>
  <li>Place the paddle perpendicular to the kayak, with the shaft resting on the boat behind your seat, and one of the blades resting on the beach for stability.</li>
  <li>Hold onto the paddle as you sit on back edge of cockpit.</li>
  <li>With one hand on each side of the paddle, lift your feet into the boat, then lower yourself down onto your seat.</li>
  <li>Hold the paddle vertically in one hand, and make a fist with the other. Push the paddle and your fist into the beach, pushing yourself into the water. It helps to also use the momentum of your hips to scoot into the water.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="bgBox">
  <div>
  <h6 id="tandems">Tips for Tandems</h6>
  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Decide who is the bow paddler (in the front) and who is at the stern. The stern paddle is typically the more comfortable steering partner. This partner will probably have to get their feet wet.</li>
    <li>Carry the bow of your kayak out into the water.</li>
    <li>The bow paddler should get in first, holding onto the paddles.</li>
    <li>The stern paddler will then push the boat parallel into the shore and hop in, feet first, keeping their center of gravity as low as possible.</li>
  </ul> </div>

  <h6>Launching from a Dock</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
    <img id="dockLaunch" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/catherine-hughes--jIejChVVPw-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>
    <ul class="bg-p">
      <li>Place your kayak parallel to the dock, and your paddle at the edge of the dock where it will be within reach once you are in the kayak.</li>
      <li>If you have paddling friend nearby, ask them to hold the deck lines on your kayak to keep it stable as you enter.</li>
      <li>Keep your upper body weight on the dock and keep your center of gravity low as you enter the boat feet first.</li>
      <li>Twist your torso to sit in the seat as you slide your legs down into the boat. The key is to sit down in your seat as quickly as possible.</li>
      <li>Once settled, push off from the dock.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h6>Entering a Boat Already Floating in the Water</h6>
  <p class="bg-p">Ideally, you should enter your boat while it is floating in the water to prevent any damage to the bottom. If you have a composite boat, you should always enter the boat while it is floating. If the stern on shore, you won’t be able to paddle away.</p>
  <div class="bgBox">
  <ul class="bg-p">
  <li>Stand with both feet on the same side of the boat.</li>
  <li>Use your paddle as outrigger, holding the paddle shaft and the back of the combing around the cockpit in one hand, and keeping the other hand on the paddle close to the boat so you’re not putting strain on it.</li>
  <li>Push extended blade through water and onto ground to provide balance.</li>
  <li>Sit on back deck, and once you’re balanced, slide feet in and sit on the seat.</li>
  <li>Take a few strokes right away so don’t get pushed back onto the shore.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Launching from a Rocky Shore</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">

  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Float your kayak in the water, parallel to the shore.</li>
    <li>Use your paddle as an outrigger for support: Place the paddle perpendicular to the kayak, with the shaft resting on the boat behind your seat, and one of the blades resting on the shore for support.</li>
    <li>Squat beside the kayak and grasp the paddle with both hands behind your behind back.</li>
    <li>Carefully slip into the boat the boat feet first, while keeping a little of your weight balancing on the paddle. It will be key to sit down on your seat as quickly as possible, especially if you have waves to contend with.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="bgBox">
  <div>
  <h6>Once You're in the Water...</h6>
  <br>
  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Gently get comfortable, feeling out the initial and secondary points of contact</li>
    <li>Move so the seatback engages</li>
    <li>Put your feet on the footrests</li>
    <li>Doublecheck that your life jacket is still in place</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="land">How to Land Your Kayak</a></h4>

  <p class="bg-p">When possible, look for a gently sloping beach or boat launch to land your kayak. Ideally, you are looking for a calm, stable, sheltered area to get out of your kayak.</p>

  <img id="landImg" src="https://github.com/lauren1113/Kayak-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Documents/Design/Kayak%20Photos/joshua-bedford-GQ9_rEhfKfw-unsplash.jpg?raw=true"/>

  <h6>Landing on a Beach</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Paddle your boat to the edge of the shore, bringing the cockpit as close to the shoreline as possible.</li>
    <li>If you have a paddling partner, ask them to hold your kayak steady as you exit.</li>
    <li>Place your paddle behind your seat, with one blade on the beach for stability.</li>
    <li>Push yourself up so you are resting some your weight on the paddle as you pull your knees up and out of the cockpit. </li>
    <li>Carefully plant your feet onto the beach and push yourself up to stand. </li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Paddle your kayak up to the dock, bringing it parallel to the dock and as close as possible.</li>
    <li>Set your paddle on the dock before you get out, so it doesn’t fall into the water.</li>
    <li>If you have a paddling friend nearby, ask them to hold the deck lines of your kayak for you to keep it stable.</li>
    <li>Lean against the dock, pull your knees up and out of the cockpit, and slide your legs out as you sit onto the dock.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h6>Landing Near a Rocky Shore</h6>
  <div class="bgBox">
  <ul class="bg-p">
    <li>Paddle your kayak up to the shore, bringing it parallel to the shore and as close as possible.</li>
    <li>Use your paddle as an outrigger for support: Place the paddle perpendicular to the kayak, with the shaft resting on the boat behind your seat, and one of the blades resting on the shore for support.</li>
    <li>Push yourself up so you are resting some your weight and balancing on the paddle, as you pull your knees up and out of the cockpit.</li>
    <li>Carefully plant your feet onto the shore and push yourself up.</li>
    <li>This will be difficult if you have any waves to contend with… You’re always best to find a completely sheltered spot for landing.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="bg-p">
  <li>If you are using a skirt, take it off before you get to the shore to save time. Raise your rudders and skegs before entering shallow water.</li>
  <li>Approach the shore straight on. In rough water, you may need to time your landing in between sets of waves.</li>
  <li>Use your paddle as an outrigger for support: Place the paddle perpendicular to the kayak, with the shaft resting on the boat behind your seat, and one of the blades resting on the ground for support.</li>
  <li>Hold the paddle shaft and the back of the combing behind your seat with one hand, and hold the paddle close to the boat with your other hand.</li>
  <li>Push yourself up to sit on the back deck and pull your legs out of the cockpit.</li>
  <li>Plant both feet firmly on the same side of the kayak.</li>
  <li>Stand up and guide your kayak into the shore.</li>

  <h4 class="sectionTitle"><a id="what2wear">What to Wear</a></h4>
  <div class="bgBox">
  <ul class="bg-p">
  <li>You should always wear a personal flotation device, especially when kayaking in the ocean.</li>
  <li>Dress for the temperature of the water, rather than the temperature of the air.</li>
  <li>Dry-fit/quick-drying clothing is highly recommended. Avoid cotton on all layers, as it absorbs water and takes a long time to dry.</li>
  <li>Wear clothes that allow you to move comfortably.</>
  <li>Dress in layers - you can always take a layer off if you find it unnecessary once you're out on the water.</li>
  <li>Protect yourself from the sun and wear UPF-fabric clothing when possible (in addition to sunscreen!).</li>
  </ul>
