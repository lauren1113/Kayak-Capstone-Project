## Savvy Coders Capstone Project

**Description:**

Kayak Fanatic is an Adventure Guide for kayakers, with tips, trips, tools, and tricks for fun, safe, and successful kayak trips!

Essentially, my goal is to develop a complete guide to kayaking. So far, I have built a Beginner's Guide to Kayaking, with details about almost everything you need to know to get started, and a Track My Kayak page, which uses geolocation to track your journey and how far you've traveled. Next, I plan to build float finders, with information about nearby lakes and rivers; packing lists; a page for safety tips, and a matchmaking quiz that beginners can take to find the best kayaks to fit their needs.  I also plan to add a way for viewers to contribute their input, such as adding photos and reviews of lakes and rivers, and a way to upload current water conditions to inform other kayakers as they plan their next adventure.
