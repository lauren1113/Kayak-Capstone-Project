Kayak Fanatic is an Adventure Guide for kayakers, with tips, tricks, and tools for fun, safe, and successful kayak trips!

This is my first coding project, which I began during the **Savvy Coders** Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp, beginning in June 2020. I used JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Firebase, and map APIs to develop this Single Page Application. 

When I’m not sitting at my computer for hours trying to crack a code, I am a very outdoorsy and adventurous person. I recently started kayaking, and I have quickly become quite the enthusiast! Before I got started, I spent a lot of time searching several different websites, trying to figure out everything I needed to know to get started: what type of kayak would be right for me, where should I go, what do I wear, how do I paddle, everything. So during my summer with Savvy Coders, I decided to combine my two new passions – coding and kayaking – and I began developing an application that has all of the resources kayakers may need, all in one place.

So far, I have built a Beginner's Guide to Kayaking, with details about almost everything you need to know to get started, and a Track My Kayak page, which uses geolocation to track your journey and how far you've traveled. Next, I plan to build float finders, with information about nearby lakes and rivers; packing lists; safety tips, and a matchmaking quiz that beginners can take to find the best kayaks to fit their needs.  I also plan to add a way for viewers to contribute their input, such as adding photos and reviews of lakes and rivers, and a way to upload current water conditions to inform other kayakers as they plan their next adventure.
